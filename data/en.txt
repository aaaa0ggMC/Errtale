Long long ago,there were two races--HUMANS and MONSTERS
One day,war broke out between the two races
At last,the human won and sealed the monsters undergound with a magic spell
Incredibly,the monsters built a civilization undergound
They have had a peaceful life for a quite some time
In 201X,however,a small child fell into Mt.Ebbot
And the child led the civilization become friendly with humans
While in 202X,things changed,a human became evil and killed all of the human
And he also killed all of the monsters except........
me!!!!!
And you,are the guy...........
My friend,my family,my world were all destroyed by you,a silly child.....
Good bye.......
Let's go to the theme...
